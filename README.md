# BarelyJarvis 
Welcome to BarelyJarvis my totally serious attempt to build a jarvis-like system even though i have my budget and sleep schedule hanging by a thread.

RIght now i am building the software part, because i dont have the hardware yet - thats exactly why m applying for Hack Club $400 Grant

Once I get the funding i will finally be able to buy the projector, webcam, acrylic sheet, mic, and other parts to turn this into a full sci-fi setup
For now BarelyJarvis runs on my PC in “prototype mode” but the plan is way bigger

# what barelyjarvis can do right now
- talks in jarvis style
- has memory (like 10 message)
- opens apps using secret execution codes
- fast response using Groq Llama 3.3

 Basically its jarvis but barely jarvis

 # voice mode (coming soon)
im adding voice synthesis + speech input, so that BarelyJarvis can

 - talk like a gentleman or
 - listen to me cry

# UI Plans (just ideas for now)
Im planning to build a sci-fi interface for BarelyJarvis
Right now none of this is built yet 

The planned ui will have

- clean widgets
- a command panel
- smooth animation (nothing crazy)
- a circle thingy that moves when it talks
- quick app shortcuts

# how to run (if u dare)
1. install deps
    ```bash
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. throw ur groq api into the code
3. run it
  ```bash
    $ python3 barelyjarvis.py
  ```
4. ask anything like - open spotify
5. pray it dont roast you

# Status - (  building slowly but surely kinda)
- BarelyJarvis is alive (maybe)
